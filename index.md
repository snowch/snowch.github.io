## About

I help enterprise and public sector teams turn ambitious data and AI goals into scalable, production-ready outcomes—leveraging open source, agentic AI, and deep domain expertise.

With 25+ years in IT—including 14 years in BI, data warehousing, NoSQL, Java development/architecture, Linux administration, and security, over 10 years in presales, and the most recent 11+ years in data engineering, data science, and AI—I bridge strategy and execution: shaping architectures, guiding technical direction, and delivering solutions aligned with business value.
