# Observability Anomaly Detection

Build production-ready anomaly detection systems using ResNet embeddings for observability data.

## Topics Covered

- **ResNet Architecture**: Understanding residual networks and adapting them for tabular data
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming OCSF observability data into model-ready features
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Training on unlabeled data using contrastive learning
- **Embedding Quality**: Evaluating embeddings with quantitative and qualitative methods
- **Anomaly Detection**: Applying distance-based, density-based, and ensemble methods
- **Production Deployment**: FastAPI services, vector databases, and real-time inference
- **MLOps**: Monitoring, drift detection, and automated retraining
- **Multi-Source Correlation**: Root cause analysis across logs, metrics, and traces

## What You'll Build

A complete production system including:

- Custom TabularResNet model trained with self-supervised learning
- Embedding service (FastAPI) for real-time inference
- Vector database for fast k-NN similarity search
- Anomaly detection through vector operations
- Monitoring and automated retraining pipeline
