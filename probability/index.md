# Probability Tutorials & Notes

*Visual guides to probability concepts with interactive examples*

---

This section contains tutorial notes on select probability topics, designed to build intuition through visualizations and hands-on examples. These tutorials complement the full [Learn Probability](https://snowch.github.io/learn_probability/) book.

## What's Here

These are standalone tutorials that dive deep into specific probability concepts:

* - Tutorial
  - What You'll Learn
* - [Inclusion-Exclusion Principle](inclusion_exclusion_tutorial.md)
  - *Counting unions without double-counting* — Visual guide using Venn diagrams to understand how to count elements in set unions
* - [Birthday Paradox](birthday_tutorial.md)
  - *Why 23 people give 50% chance of shared birthdays* — Build intuition for this counterintuitive result using complement counting
```

## Learning Approach

**Visual First:** Each tutorial uses Venn diagrams, plots, and interactive Python examples to build intuition before diving into formulas.

**Concrete Examples:** We start with specific numbers and work up to general principles, making abstract concepts tangible.

**Hands-On Code:** All tutorials are executable Jupyter notebooks—run them, modify them, experiment!

## Full Probability Course

For a comprehensive probability education covering fundamental concepts through advanced topics, see the complete guide:

**[Learn Probability →](https://snowch.github.io/learn_probability/)**

The full course includes:
- Fundamental probability concepts and axioms
- Conditional probability and independence
- Bayes' theorem and applications
- Random variables and distributions
- Expected value and variance
- Common distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal, Exponential, etc.)
- Interactive Python examples throughout

## Why Probability Matters for AI/ML

Understanding probability is foundational for:
- **Machine Learning:** Models make probabilistic predictions, not deterministic ones
- **Bayesian Methods:** Prior beliefs updated with evidence
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Understanding model confidence
- **Statistical Testing:** Evaluating model performance rigorously
- **Generative Models:** Sampling from learned distributions

## Prerequisites

These tutorials assume:
- Basic algebra (no calculus required)
- Familiarity with sets and basic counting
- Python basics (for code examples)

## Where to Start

**New to probability?** Start with the [full course](https://snowch.github.io/learn_probability/) to build foundations.
