But how are they actually built inside?\n\n### Master-Slave Architecture\n\nMost D flip-flops use a **master-slave** design with two latches in series:\n\n1. **Master latch** — Captures input D when clock is HIGH\n2. **Slave latch** — Captures master's output when clock is LOW\n3. **Result:** Output Q only changes on the clock *edge* (HIGH→LOW transition)\n\nThis two-stage design is what creates **edge-triggered** behavior. The master samples the input during one half of the clock cycle, then the slave transfers it to the output during the other half.\n\n### Why This Visualization Matters\n\nUnderstanding the nanosecond-level timing inside the flip-flop reveals:\n\n- **Why setup and hold times exist** — The master latch needs time to stabilize before the clock edge\n- **Why there's clock-to-Q delay** — The slave latch takes time to propagate the signal to Q\n- **How edge triggering works** — See the master/slave handoff in slow motion\n- **What happens during metastability** — Watch what occurs when timing is violated\n\nThis interactive visualization lets you step through each nanosecond and see the internal signals as the flip-flop captures and outputs data.\n\n<a href=\"d-flip-flop-viz.html\">\n  <img src=\"d-flip-flop-viz.jpg\" alt=\"D Flip-Flop Visualization\" width=\"600\">\n</a>\n\n**[Launch the Interactive Visualization](d-flip-flop-viz.html)**\n\n*Tip: After exploring the visualization, you'll have a much deeper understanding of why the timing parameters from the tutorial are critical for reliable operation.*"
