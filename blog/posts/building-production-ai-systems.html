            <h1>Building Production-Ready AI Systems</h1>
            <p class="post-meta">December 4, 2024</p>

            <p>After years of deploying AI solutions in enterprise environments, I've learned that the gap between a working prototype and a production system is larger than most teams anticipate. Here are some key lessons.</p>

            <h2>Start with the End in Mind</h2>
            <p>Before writing any code, understand how the system will be monitored, maintained, and scaled. Production systems need observability built in from day one—not bolted on later.</p>

            <h2>Data Quality is Everything</h2>
            <p>The most sophisticated model will fail if fed poor quality data. Invest heavily in data validation, monitoring for drift, and clear data contracts between systems.</p>

            <h2>Plan for Failure</h2>
            <p>AI systems can fail in subtle ways that traditional software doesn't. Build graceful degradation paths, set up alerting for model performance metrics, and always have a fallback strategy.</p>

            <h2>Document Everything</h2>
            <p>Future you (and your colleagues) will thank you. Document not just the what, but the why—especially for architectural decisions and model choices.</p>
